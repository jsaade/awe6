`awe6` is `game` inverted: a scalable, flexible and intuitive framework for the rapid development of [quality games](DeveloperGallery.md).

Adopting an inversion-of-control + entity-component concept awe6 comes with both [big ideas and batteries included](ProjectObjectives.md): [assets](ComponentAssets.md), [inputs](ComponentInputs.md), [audio](ComponentAudio.md), [session](ComponentSession.md), [scenes](ComponentScene.md) and [preloading](ComponentPreloader.md) are handled "out of the box" using the templates provided.

[Why?](DeveloperBenefits.md) Because games need components, components need structure, structures need frames.  awe6 is a game framework api: populate it with components, systems and gameplay.
