# Why is awe6 Useful? / The Sales Pitch. #

Here are some at-a-glance benefits towards developing games using frameworks, and the benefits to making awe6 your framework of choice:

## Why are Game Frameworks Useful? ##

  * Common, consistent language.  Multiple people, multiple projects, multiple disciplines all using the same words.
  * Benefit from the expertise of others.  By using a stable, proven codebase many pitfalls can be totally avoided and complex concepts adopted (even without understanding).
  * Avoid reinventing the wheel.  Adoption of abstracts allows a developer to concentrate on the concrete, and "get the job done" quicker.
  * Focus on the fun.  Many games developers would rather concentrate their efforts on the "fluff" than the "crunch".
  * Code reuse.  By using a framework [separation of concerns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) is encouraged, allowing code to be modular and reusable.
  * Frameworks = easier = faster = maintainable = teachable = better value.

## Ok Sold, But Why awe6? ##

  * Designed to relieve pain.  This framework was developed by senior developers with tens of thousands of hours of professional games development team experience for one purpose - to build great games easily.
  * Versatility / adaptable architecture - this framework was designed for games of [any type](GameGenres.md).
  * Top down approach.  By addressing game design using [Inversion Of Control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control) focus is on flow, relationships and reuse (rather than spaghetti).
  * Talk in plain language.  A game is described as a collection of scenes which allow entities to interact with one another and their respective agendas.
  * More [design patterns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern_(computer_science)) than we'd care to list.  They're pretty much all in here (except Singleton!), doing the job they need to do without ego.
  * Ready-to-run boilerplate.  Fully [Agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) methodology friendly out of the tin ... every project starts from a working, compilable game ... iterate until "complete".
  * Follows strict and mature [conventions](CodingConventions.md) leading to development benefits such as [Solid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_(object-oriented_design)).
  * Future proof.  Platform agnostic declarative interfaces means this framework is concerned with what (constant), not how (flux).
  * Leverages the great work of others.  Encourages the inclusion of the "best tool for the job" (e.g. physics, rendering etc) via third party libraries rather than provide one-stop-shop lesser alternatives.
  * Proven and deployed.  Millions of gamers have enjoyed [games made with awe6](DeveloperGallery.md), you can be sure it is robust.
  * This framework is just the beginning.  Designed to drive IDEs, commercial component channels, dynamically loaded libraries and multi platform targets, the awe6 story is just beginning.

## Community Framework (e.g. awe6 under MIT license) vs Developing Proprietary Framework? ##

  * Usefulness.  Community projects are by definition "useful" else they wouldn't exist (there is no other motivation).
  * Demonstrable quality control / "Linus' Law".  Community projects are open to public scrutiny, therefore anything that can be considered "wrong", will be identified and likely addressed.
  * Compatibility.  Permissive licenses allow code to be used in almost all circumstances.  Proprietary tends towards restriction or risks incompatibility.  Saves time, reduces risk.
  * Customization.  Use what you need, in part or in full.  Modify to suit.  Return your contributions back to the project as you see fit.  Saves time, increases opportunities.
  * Freedom.  Lock-in and proprietary technology limits future options (or makes them subject to vendor mercy) - adopting sharealike returns focus to the best solution.
  * Propagation.  Community adoption and voluntary co-development opportunities become almost impossible with proprietary.
  * Accepts reality.  Any client side proprietary code can be decompiled - there are no secrets so embrace the positive benefits of sharealike.
  * "Free" software is not anti-commercial, but highly evolved commercialism with the emphasis on value.  Sell these virtues for real money as unique selling points!
